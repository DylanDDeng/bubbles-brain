# Astro release route ownership

## Unified Chinese collection directories

The nine Chinese homepage collections use `/#bc-<collection>` as their only directory.
Their former standalone directory routes, including `/highlights/<year>/`, are removed;
no compatibility pages or redirects are generated. Article detail URLs and English routes
remain separate published content. Search, year filtering and pagination live in the
home collection room, with complete server-rendered lists for no-JavaScript reading.
`astro/route-ownership.json` declares removed directories and the build rejects their
reintroduction. Historical Markdown directory links are normalized during rendering,
without rewriting the original article files.


Phase 4 uses an explicit build-time coexistence boundary. Cloudflare Pages publishes one artifact,
`astro/dist`, while route ownership is split as follows:

- Astro owns the homepage, knowledge search, every public knowledge section (including
  `about`, `codex-tutorials`, `deepseek-harness-tutorials`, `workbuddy-tutorials`,
  `highlights`, and `x-trending`), metadata feeds, sitemaps, robots, redirects, and the
  custom 404.
- The Hugo compatibility allowlist is currently empty. The build-time compatibility renderer remains
  available for an explicitly reviewed legacy route, but it does not own a public route by default.

The machine-readable allowlist is `astro/route-ownership.json`. `npm run build --prefix astro`
builds Astro first, generates Cloudflare redirects, builds Hugo 0.147.9 in an isolated temporary
directory, and copies only declared compatibility HTML and bundled MP4 resources into `astro/dist`.
RSS, sitemap, JSON, robots, redirects, and custom 404 output remain Astro-owned. The merge fails if
Hugo would overwrite an existing Astro file. It records every copied file and SHA-256 digest in
`release-manifests/legacy-compat-manifest.json`, then deletes the temporary Hugo output. The
non-hidden directory is intentional because Cloudflare Pages does not publish dot-directories from
the uploaded artifact.

The build also emits `release-manifests/site-route-manifest.json`, a complete
route/status/owner/content
type/indexability contract. `npm run verify:site` checks that manifest against the built files,
redirect targets, canonical and hreflang metadata, all 27 XML endpoints, internal links, Hugo route
parity, and representative behavior markers for image compression, model evaluations, and
highlights.

This is not a second publisher and it does not route traffic between two deployments. Cloudflare
Pages receives one immutable static artifact. Astro-owned paths can never be overwritten by the
compatibility merge. Moving a compatibility route to Astro requires a reviewed ownership-manifest
change plus URL, behavior, accessibility, and visual parity evidence.

The 99 executable files under `/eval-demos/` are static compatibility assets, not trusted app code.
Their versioned aggregate hash lives in `astro/raw-html-policy.json`; Cloudflare `_headers` applies a
CSP sandbox without `allow-same-origin`, disables indexing, strips referrers, and denies sensitive
browser capabilities. A later release may move them to a dedicated origin without changing the
knowledge routes.

Cloudflare Pages is the sole production publisher. GitHub Actions builds and uploads an immutable
`astro/dist` verification artifact but no longer publishes GitHub Pages. Rollback keeps the previous
standalone Hugo Cloudflare deployment and its build configuration for at least one complete release
cycle.
